# portfolio-c-plus-plus
This is my hub of all my projects from CSCI-155 Intro to C++

~Directory Layout:

    ** Executable shell programs are in the root directory
    ** ./Hacks/ contains all the C++ source code for those shell programs
    ** ./public_html/ contains stuff viewable from http://csci155.kbox.org/~turnerec/
         ** ./public_html/cgi-bin/ contains C++ and the web-equivalant .cgi files
         ** ./public_html/output contains file output from any executed web scripts
